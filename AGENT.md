# AGENT Implementation Log

## Interpretation of Requirements
- Follow Clean Architecture with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation layers.
- DI using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection with proper lifetimes.
- Add context rich debug logging across services and ViewModels.
- Track progress per PHASE_ONE_PLAN.md and other docs.

## Implementation Plan
1. Review documentation in `/docs` folder for architecture, coding standards and phase plan.
2. Examine existing code to understand current state.
3. Enhance logging in services and ViewModels.
4. Ensure dependency injection is configured as per Infrastructure layer.
5. Document progress and any questions here.

## Progress
- Documentation reviewed.
- Added detailed debug logging to all service and repository methods.
- Injected `ILogger<T>` into DashboardViewModel, PlaceholderViewModel and MainPageViewModel.
- Updated view code to create ViewModels with loggers when DI is not used.
- Added AGENT.md for tracking ongoing tasks.
- Addressed PR feedback: added context-rich logging to repositories and services
- Provided NullLogger instances for views when DI not available
- Started Data Persistence phase: added DatabaseOptions, updated DbContext to use SQLCipher connection and added DbSets.
- Registered DatabaseOptions and DbContext in DI container.
- Attempted to run EF Core migration generation but build failed due to missing .NET 9 SDK.
- Fixed build errors by adding missing Microsoft.Extensions.Logging using statements to repositories.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Complete EF Core migrations once .NET 9 SDK is available.
- Implement advanced UI features in later phases.

- Build currently fails because .NET 9 SDK is missing in the environment.
- Implemented basic audit logging:
  - Added `AuditLogEntry` entity and `IAuditService` interface
  - Created `AuditService` using EF Core for persistence and registered with DI
  - Extended `OperationPrimeDbContext` with `AuditLogEntries` DbSet and index configuration
  - IncidentService now records audit actions on create, update and delete
- Database migrations still blocked due to missing .NET SDK
- dotnet build/test executed but fail due to missing SDK on runner
- Fixed DI configuration error by creating an in-memory configuration for the database options and passing it to AddInfrastructure.
- Updated App.xaml.cs accordingly with required using statements.
- Build still fails because dotnet is not installed in the environment.
- Build verified successfully on local machine. Implementation continues with data persistence.
- Added OperationPrimeDbContextFactory for EF Core design-time support.
- Plan updated to reflect migration tooling and upcoming UI tasks.
